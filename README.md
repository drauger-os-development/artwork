Wallpapers and other images used in Drauger OS.

Want to see your wallpaper in Drauger OS? Open a PR to merge your image in!

Please place any wallpapers in `usr/share/backgrounds`, with the following file name formating:

`(short description)-(width)x(height)-(resolution shorthand).(file extension)`

So, a picture that displays a black/grey fractal pattern, is 1080p in resolution, and uses the JPEG image format could be named:

```
black-fractal-1920x1080-FHD.jpg
```
or
```
dark-fractal-1920x1080-1080p.jpeg
```

The former would be the preferred name, as FHD is more understandable than 1080p for some people.
